### 2.10 Audit and Logging
- The system must maintain an audit trail of all user activities, including login attempts, leave requests, approvals, and changes to personal information.
- The system should provide logs for system administrators to monitor and review system activities.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements describe the system's operational attributes and constraints to ensure usability, reliability, performance, and supportability.

### Usability
- The system should have an intuitive user interface that is easy to navigate.
- User manuals and help documentation should be provided.

### Performance
- The system should respond quickly and handle many users simultaneously without slowing down.

### Reliability
- The system should be available and operational almost all the time.
- Backup and recovery procedures should prevent data loss.

### Security
- All data should be encrypted and protected.
- The system should comply with data protection regulations.
- Regular security checks should be conducted.

### Maintainability
- The system should be easy to update and modify.
- Detailed technical documentation should be provided.

### Scalability
- The system should be able to grow and handle more users as needed.
- Cloud deployment options should be considered for flexibility.

### Compatibility
- The system should work with various web browsers and devices.
- The system should integrate with existing HR systems and databases.

## 4. Constraints
- **Utilization of Current Infrastructure**: The system should utilize the existing IT infrastructure to minimize additional costs.
- **Integration with Existing Intranet Portal**: The system must integrate seamlessly with the current intranet portal.
- **Communication with Old HR Systems**: The system must be capable of communicating with legacy HR systems to ensure continuity and data integrity.
  
## 5. Use Cases

### 5.2 Manage Time Use Case
This section contains detailed use cases related to managing time within the system.

#### 5.2.1 Create Request
- Employees can create a request for time off (vacation, sick leave, etc.).
- The request will be sent to their manager for approval.
  
#### 5.2.2 Withdraw Or Edit Pending Request
- Employees can withdraw or edit a request that has not yet been approved.
- Once withdrawn, the request will no longer be considered by the manager.

#### 5.2.3 Cancel Approved Request
- Employees can cancel a previously approved request if necessary.
- Cancellation will notify the manager and adjust the leave balance accordingly.
